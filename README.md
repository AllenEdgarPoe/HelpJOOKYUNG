# 주경이를 도와줘!

This repository contains various code snippets I've created for my own use. I'll log daily entries about what I've been working on.

## Introduction

These codes are not part of a consistent project, but rather a collection of 'helper codes' that I've needed at one point or another and decided to store for future needs.

## Logs

  - By using openAI Chatgpt API, I can build my own chatbot with code.

## How to Use

To use a code snippet from this repository, just download the specific file and run it on your own system. If the code requires any specific environment or packages, it will be noted at the top of the file.

## Requirements

Most codes are written in Python 3.6 or above. Necessary packages will be noted within each script file.
